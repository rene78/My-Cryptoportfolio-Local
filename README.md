# My Cryptoportfolio - Local
Website: [MyCryptoportfolio](https://rene78.github.io/My-Cryptoportfolio-Local/)

A fully local web app to get an overview over your cryptoportfolio. Nobody will ever see your private portfolio information. The only external API call is to Cryptocompare to get the current crypto prices.

# How-to-use

* Copy index.html to a convenient place on your hard drive.
* Go to line 95 of index.html and replace the demoportfolio with your own one.
* Double-click index.html.


Obiously this app will not sync with multiple devices. If you want this feature check out my [full-stack app](https://github.com/rene78/My-Cryptoportfolio).

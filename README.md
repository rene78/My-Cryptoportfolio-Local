# My Cryptoportfolio
Website: [MyCryptoportfolio](https://rene78.github.io/My-Cryptoportfolio-Local/)

A fully local web app to get an overview over your cryptoportfolio. Nobody will ever see your private portfolio information. The only external API call is to Cryptocompare to get the current crypto prices.

**Go to line 95 of index.html and replace the demoportfolio with your own one.**

Obiously this app will not sync with multiple devices. If you want this feature check out my [full-stack app](https://github.com/rene78/My-Cryptoportfolio)
